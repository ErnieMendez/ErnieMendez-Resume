        <div class="subheading mb-5">PsychologyðŸ“š</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Ernie Mendez and I am currently a fourth year college student at the University of Riverside, California. I am majoring in psychology and plan to graduate in the spring of 2021. I was born and raised in Riverside, California and have four brothers and two sisters. I am the youngest sibling and I am 21 years old. I have goals of going to graduate school to obtain a doctorate in psychology after I graduate with a B.A. from my current university. I am passionate about mental health and improving oneâ€™s own psychological well-being. I am a big advocate for reaching out to mental health resources, and providing those in need with mental health assistance. Moreover, I am an advocate for prioritizing mental health and mental health awareness. <br><br>

        I am passionate about education and giving back to my community. I thoroughly enjoy volunteering and lending a helping hand to those who need it most. I have a plethora of volunteering experience and it brings me pure joy to know that I am doing what I can to improve the world around me. I am always looking to learn new things and experience new memories in my professional career and in my personal life. I believe in hard work above all else. I enjoy setting goals and pushing myself to achieve them. I am passionate about family and surrounding myself with people that possess an undying ambition to further themselves professionally and personally as well. I believe in the power and strength of a good team. With that, comes the need to be a good teammate, and I am always striving to be a better teammate. Collaboration, creativity, and communication are three things I whole-heartedly believe make up a strong team and a strong individual. Leadership is also an area that I have experience in. I have worked in a non-profit organization where I was able to get experience in not only being a part of a team of dedicated individuals, but I was able to work my way up in the organization and become a leader to the fellow volunteers as the assistant director. <br><br>

        I am currently a research assistant for the Childhood Cognition Lab at the University of California, Riverside. My hope is to one day work with children and provide them with any mental health resources they need. Working in this lab provides me with responsibility and exposes me to the field of research within psychology that has implications for the area of practice within psychology. I believe in empowering the youth and providing them any and all resources possible to make them stronger and smarter, ultimately creating a domino effect of future generations that are constantly improving the world they live in. I hope that I can inspire others to pursue their passion and work endlessly until they achieve their goals in this life. I firmly believe everyone has the potential to be the person they want to be through hard work and education. I hope to inspire others to see the beauty in this life and reach the equanimity they all deserve.
